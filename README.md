As part of my final year project, My team developed an "Automatic Routine Generator using Genetic Algorithm". The aim of the project was to tackle the complex problem of creating timetables for Unversity that deal with theory classes, laboratory classes and breaks.

# Project Overview




Our team used the genetic algorithm to optimize the general university course scheduling process. Our system generates the routine based on provided inputs such as teacher details, classroom details, and lab details. The system generates each class routine as well as individual teacher routine in PDF form which can be downloaded and printed.

The genetic algorithm we used involved iterative processes of generating population, crossover, and mutation until the optimal solution was generated. The algorithm took inputs as constraints, and depending on whether the constraints were essential or desirable, they were categorized as "hard" and "soft" respectively.

We tackled the NP-Hard problem of course timetabling, and we used Darwin's theory of evolution as the basis for our genetic algorithm. Our project offers a unique solution to a complex problem and provides a feasible and optimized course timetable for educational institutions.

Overall, it was an exciting and challenging project that allowed us to apply our skills and knowledge to real-world problems. I am proud of the outcome and what our team accomplished together.
